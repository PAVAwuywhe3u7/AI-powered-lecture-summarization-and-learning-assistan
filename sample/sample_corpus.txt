Lecture Title: Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each scenario.

Key topics covered:
- Supervised learning and its use of labeled training data.
- Unsupervised learning and clustering unknown structures.
- Overfitting versus underfitting and the bias-variance tradeoff.
- Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Practical examples: spam filtering, recommendation engines, medical risk prediction.

Revision checkpoints:
- Define supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Explain why train/test splits are required.
- Identify when precision is more important than recall.
- Describe overfitting and regularization strategies.
